# THE GRID POC

Live site: https://the-grid-poc.netlify.app/
try /irontom for a set up grid

## Ideas
- [ ] Add markdown widget? This might result in ðŸ’© looking widgets
- [ ] Add Github showcase (can't be done with iframe)
- [ ] Add text color class options to title and text widgets
- [ ] Add possibility of adding hyperlink to title widget, or add a link widget.

## To-dos
- [ ] Fix responsiveness bug that makes items overlap. Could be done by using responsive layouts or fixing the bug in the lib. Remove the workaround.
- [ ] Add DIY grid that saves on local storage.

# vue-project

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
